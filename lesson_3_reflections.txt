When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You would want to use a remote repo whenever you are working on a project with multiple people contributing. 
Also if you want others to be able to see your code and the different edits, you could use a remote repo.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with 
your remote repository?
You would always want to pull changes manually so that unfinished parts of the code don't get automatically 
pulled making the file unfinished. If you only manually pull and push changes, then you will only have 
completed versions of the file.
