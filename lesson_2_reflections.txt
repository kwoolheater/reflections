What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
This creates a file named .git. This is neccessary in order to have any sort of version control
because this is where you save all of the versions of your code. Otherwise you will just have 
files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do
you think it offers?
I believe the working directory is the directory and everything that you have saved. That is why
you can add things to it and look at the status of files through it.
